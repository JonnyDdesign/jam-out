## About This Project
This project represents a React web application that allows users to create custom playlists for Spotify users.<br />
<br />I utilized my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

## Technologies Used
React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, along with the Spotify API.

## Setup/Installation
After cloning the repository, change to the current directory and run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
